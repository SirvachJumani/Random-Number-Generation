Monte Carlo Simulation Methods - Random Number Generation Technique

Conculsion of the Poster presentation:
Pseudo-Random number generation technique with different methods such as Fibonacci Generator, Inversive Congruential Generator, Multiply with carry Generator, and Combined Generator. All random number generators are good in terms of uniformity, randomness, and independence. Also, the Combined Generator takes the longest time to generates its sequences.
